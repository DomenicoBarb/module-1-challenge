# User Story
AS A marketing agency

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## How I completed my assignment
I cloned the starter code using GitHub and from there I used VS Code to refactor the HTML and CSS code. This website has had it's (HTML and CSS) code "refactored", meaning the code has been streamlined and reorganized. The code was organized and in some areas simplified.
